## Notes

Challenges Encountered:
	1.	Git Remote Configuration: Initially, there was an issue pushing changes to the correct repository, which was resolved by updating the remote URL to point to the forked repository.
	2.	Filtering Games: Properly implementing the “Show Unfunded Only” and “Show Funded Only” filters required careful use of the filter() method and DOM manipulation.
	3.	Dynamic Stats Update: Ensuring the stats updated dynamically when games were filtered was a rewarding challenge.
